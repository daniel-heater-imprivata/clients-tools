- [ ] Unified build system
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)

### Quality
- [ ] >80% test coverage
- [ ] All sanitizers passing (ASAN, TSAN, LSAN)
- [ ] Stress testing (1000+ concurrent connections)

---

## Phase 2: Gatekeeper Migration (Q1 - Q2 2026)

**Goal**: Replace Java Connect with C++/Zig implementation

### Gatekeeper
- [ ] C++/Zig implementation using librssconnect
- [ ] Multi-connection scaling (100+ concurrent)

**Goal**: Enable external integrations

### SDKs
- [ ] Stable C API with ABI guarantees
- [ ] Comprehensive SDK documentation
- [ ] Example integrations (Python, Go, etc.)
- [ ] Language bindings (Python, Go)
- [ ] Conan package improvements

### Documentation
- [ ] Integration guides
- [ ] Customer support materials
- [ ] API reference documentation
- [ ] Video tutorials

### Customer Adoption
- [ ] 3+ customer integrations
- [ ] Customer feedback loop
- [ ] Support infrastructure

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (2027+)

**Goal**: Next-generation capabilities

### Protocol Support
- [ ] HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support
- [ ] QUIC transport option
- [ ] Additional protocol support (as needed)

### Performance
- [ ] Advanced caching and optimization
- [ ] Connection pooling
- [ ] Load balancing

### Cloud Native
- [ ] Kubernetes integration
- [ ] Cloud deployment support
- [ ] Containerization

### Audit Enhancements
- [ ] Real-time analytics
- [ ] AI-powered anomaly detection
- [ ] Enhanced session replay

## Migration Roadmap: Java â†’ C++/Zig

### Current State
- **Gatekeeper**: Java (production)
- **Client Applications**: Mixed (migrating to librssconnect)
- **Audit**: Java (stable)

### Target State (Q2 2026)
- **Gatekeeper**: C++/Zig
- **Client Applications**: librssconnect (C++)
- **Audit**: Java (no immediate migration planned)

### Migration Strategy
1. **librssconnect First** - Prove C++ implementation in client apps
2. **Gatekeeper Next** - Higher complexity, more connections
3. **Audit Later** - Stable, no immediate need to migrate

### Deprecation Timeline
- **Q4 2025**: Java Connect marked deprecated
- **Q1 2026**: Gatekeeper migration begins
- **Q2 2026**: Java Connect removed from Gatekeeper
- **Q3 2026**: Java Connect fully deprecated

---

## Dependencies & Risks

### External Dependencies
- **Boost**: Stable, well-maintained
- **libssh2**: Mature, watch for security updates
- **OpenSSL**: Regular security updates required
- **Zig**: Version 0.15.1 stable, monitor 0.16.0 release

### Technical Risks
- **Gatekeeper Migration**: Complex, Java Connect still in production
- **Performance**: Must match or exceed Java performance
- **Compatibility**: Maintain protocol compatibility during migration

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Gradual rollout with rollback capability
- Performance benchmarking before production
- Maintain Java fallback during migration

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 (Q1 2026)
- âœ… All client applications using librssconnect
- âœ… >99.9% connection reliability
- âœ… Zero critical bugs in production

### Phase 2 (Q2 2026)
- âœ… Gatekeeper migrated to C++/Zig
- âœ… Performance equal or better than Java
- âœ… Java Connect deprecated

### Phase 3 (Q4 2026)
- âœ… 3+ customer SDK integrations
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation
- âœ… Positive customer feedback

### Phase 4 (2027+)
- âœ… Advanced features deployed
- âœ… Cloud-native capabilities
- âœ… Market leadership in secure remote access
